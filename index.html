        <h2>Full Metal Jacket</h2>
        <u>Full Metal Jacket" (1987), directed by Stanley Kubrick, is a gritty war drama that examines the dehumanizing effects of military training and combat during the Vietnam War. The film is divided into two parts: the first focuses on a group of Marine recruits enduring brutal basic training under the merciless Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, while the second follows one of them, "Joker," as a war correspondent in Vietnam. With its stark realism, dark humor, and unflinching critique of war, the film highlights the psychological toll of violence and the loss of individuality in soldiers.</u>
